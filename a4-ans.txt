Questions
---------

        1   How is array declaration and initialization handled?
ANS:
int b[3];
  int a[3];
  int D.1417;
  int * D.1416;
  int D.1415;

  <bb 2>:
  b[0] = 1;
  b[1] = 2;
  b[2] = 3;
first there declaration of values takes place

 
       2   Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps withan intermediate temporary?

ANS:
D.1415 = b[i];
a[i] = D.1415;
in array given value can be anything, to avoid compilation error , atemporory variable is assinged.

        3   Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
Ans:
clobber means initialisation as global variable, at end they are assinging array a and b as global so they can again reuse.
