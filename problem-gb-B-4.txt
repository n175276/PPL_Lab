Program
-------

        int main()
        {
            int a, b, c;
            b = (a + c + b) * (c + a);
            return b;
        }


Questions
---------

        1   How many  times is the expression  (a + c) computed  in the original code (as seen in the SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?
ANS:
in SSA pass (a + c)computed two times, while in FRE pass it compute one time.

        2   Have  there been  any more  optimizations  after FRE?  How will  you check?
ANS:
yes it is optimized, that it becomes a smaller size, consumes less memory, executes more rapidly, or performs fewer input/output operations.


        3   Why did  we have  to put a  "return b" in  this assignment?  What if "return b" is changed to "return 0"? Will it make any difference.
ANS:
to return the value b at the end of program
if we "return b" is changed to "return 0" , then code will return 'false' value instead of real value of b.
