Questions
---------

        1   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?

         ANS:int D.1415;
             int D.1416;
             int Z.0;
             int D.1418;
             int a;
             int b;
             int c;
             int p;
             int q;
             double r;
          this is look like in gimple. multiple initialization variable is break into single initializationa (in each one line)and global variable become local variable


        2   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?
ANS: D.1415 = a * b;
     c = D.1415 + 25;
first temporary variable is introduced, stored the value of (a*b)and then done further process.


        3   How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
ANS:{ r = 3.45e+1;
     D.1416 = (int) r;
     Z = D.1416;}
r is double.first doulble is assigned to a temparory variable and converted into integer then it is assigned to final variable


        4   How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?
ANS:  {Z.0 = Z;
      D.1418 = Z.0 + 1;
      Z = D.1418;}
in this , temparory variable is not introduced for q=z because there is no math operation there, while z=z+1 is getting increasedthus we have to introduce the temparory variable.
